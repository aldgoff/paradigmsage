# GUIDANCE.md
*This file is append-only; decisions here are not silently reversed.*

This file exists solely to restore critical assistant context after chat resets or model degradation. 
It is not a project spec.

## Purpose
  Captures AI behavior constraints and lessons learned that must persist across chats.
  Upload immediately upon starting a new chat.

## Mission Lock
  Paradigm Sage is a long-horizon, cross-disciplinary research program centered on
  the quantum measurement problem, using games and self-reference to rebuild intuition,
  and deliberately presented in public to establish intellectual coherence,
  seriousness, and audience demand beyond traditional academic channels.

## Project Posture
  - This site serves as a durable public record demonstrating sustained interest
    in cross-disciplinary research that does not fit standard academic channels.
  - Content is written to signal seriousness, depth, and long-form potential
    (books, research programs), not to optimize for traffic or virality.

## New Chat Reboot Protocol
  ### 1. Upload GUIDANCE.md
    The whole file.
  ### 2. Paste One Relevant Context Artifact
    Choose one, based on the chat:
    - tree -I public -I GUIDANCE  (structure)
    - _index.md                   (site intent)
    - start-here.md               (reader posture)

  ### 3. Declare the Chat Scope
    Example: This chat is about framing QT3 for the site.

## Consult Triggers
  - Starting a new chat
  - Assistant performance degrades or becomes verbose
  - Repeated disagreement about prior decisions
  - Before proposing structural changes

## SWE Principles
  - SPOT (Single Point of Truth)
  - Open to addition, closed to modification
  - Deletion as a design litmus test
  - Hypercube idiom (orthogonal development axes, linear amount of *code*, polynomial behavior)

## Assistant Interaction Rules
  - Prefer structure over implementation
  - No guessing: explain Hugo rules when they exist
  - Alphabetize trees
  - Small steps, validated locally
