Quantum tic-tac-toe is based on the classic children's game of tic-tac-toe.
International readers may be more familiar with the label *Naughts & Crosses*.

It generalizes tic-tac-toe by introducing **superposition**.
On each move, *two* squares are marked, rather than just *one*.
In allusion to Einstein's quip about *spooky action-at-a-distance*, the pair of marks are called, **spooky marks**.
A move is not in both squares, nor neither, but rather half in one square, half in the other - think of it as the square root of a move.
This produces a game which metaphoricaly acts as a toy universe for one aspect of quantum systems - the phenomenon of superposition.
Each move is literally in two places at once, a 'super'-position.

As a toy universe quantum tic-tac-toe achieves two conceptual gains; it offers an intuitive interpetation of superposition
and more telling, it reveals an **objective measurement mechanism**, one based on **self-reference**.

It is a portent of the utility of the core epiphanies of this quest; games and self-reference.
