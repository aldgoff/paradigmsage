title: "2006 AJP Paper"
---

This paper introduced Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe as a pedagogical game for illustrating superposition and collapse.

It is included here as prior work, not as a statement of the current QT3 program. 
The present site revisits the game’s deeper conceptual implications, which could not be explored in the original venue.
