Of all the paradigm shifts that science has muddled through, quantum mechanics has to rank as the most traumatic. 
It violates our common sense again and again, and then yet again in some completely new and unexpected way, constantly challenging rational, logical, fundamental assumptions about the nature of reality. 

It challenges **taxonomies**; is it particle or is it wave? 
It challenges **observation**; how can it possibly not have both position and momentum?
It challenges **continuity**; how can it go from here to there yet never be anywhere in between? 
It challenges **motion**; what do you mean it took both paths? 
It challenges **cause and effect**; how can uncaused causes cause effects to be random? 
It challenges **locality**; how can something over there, spacelike separated, possibly affect something over here? 
It challenges **measurement**; don’t tell me it ain’t there until I look at it, what’s wrong with you?

How is it that our common sense feels violated by quantum systems?
Why is it not a trustworthy source of intuition?
Apparently nature has conned us;
65 million years of evolution have programmed our instincts to be at odds with fundamental realitiy.
Oh, they work great at the classical level (all we were missing was the calculus), but at the quantum level - at the quantum level we are chumps.

So, we are naive about the nature of reality; challenge accepted.
Most quests begin with an epiphany, that *Aha* moment when the data lines up in a beautiful but unexpected way.
This research stems from a pair of epiphanies; *self-reference* and *games*.
Self-reference is at the heart of the major limit theorems of the last century - proofs that show where formal systems fail.
Games are toy universes, perfect for building intuition - standard scientific reductionism.
They offer some hope of *understanding* quantum systems, not just computing them,
not just predicting uncertain futures and fuzzy pasts, but actually developing an intuition about their nature.

It has been claimed that one should start at the begnning, but a paradigm shift is a gestalt phenomenon - it emerges as an integrated whole, no beginning, no ending, but rather an intricate structure where every internal depends on other internals.
You either see it, or you don't - all at once, or not at all.
Therefore, this site, like the research itself, is free form.
Dive in, somewhere, anywhere, trusting that after enough dives that elusive *Aha* momement will arrive,
that momenent when the trauma of being lost in a jungle gives way to the relief of grokking that you are actually in an orchard,
ordered, regular, structured, even planned - each tree neatly laid out, producing a structure of sublime beauty.
All it took, was a change in perspective.

Epiphanies are my great joy in life - it is my pleasure to share them with you.
