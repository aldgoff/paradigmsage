Quantum systems are counter-intuitive because they violate deeply held conceptual assumptions about how reality must behave. The purpose of this site is to examine and, where necessary, dismantle those assumptions in pursuit of a single long-standing conundrum: the quantum measurement problem — a mystery that has haunted physics for more than a century.

This exploration ranges across ideas that resist neat classification. I examine how constraints and invariants shape what is possible — in quantum physics, games, self-reference, logic, computation, metaphysics, philosophy, and theology.

The work is organized as a set of projects that appear independent on the surface but are connected at a deeper structural level. The aim is not to offer premature answers, but to develop concepts and tools for thinking clearly in domains where the rules themselves are unstable. This is a work in progress; return from time to time to see what new territory has been mapped.

**Who this is for**: readers who enjoy sustained, careful thought about difficult ideas.
**Who this is not for**: those seeking quick explanations or light diversion.
