title: "The Paradigm of Paradox"
---

This is a book in progress.

Between each technical chapter is a *Paradigm Discourse* — a short, fictional dialogue
between recurring characters. These discourses are not decorative; they introduce the
conceptual tension of the chapter that follows, without technical machinery.

You may read linearly, or enter at any chapter. The discourses are optional, but recommended.
