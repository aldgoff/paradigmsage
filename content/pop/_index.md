title: "The Paradigm of Paradox"
type: "serial"
---

This is a serialization of a book in progress.
The "The Paradigm of Paradox" is an investigation into self-reference as the key to the quantum measurement problem.

Preceeding each technical chapter is a *Paradigm Discourse* — a short, fictional dialogue
between recurring characters. These discourses are not decorative; they introduce the
conceptual tension of the chapter that follows, without technical machinery.

You may read linearly, or enter at any chapter. 
The discourse introduces the topic, the chapter dives into the techncial details.
